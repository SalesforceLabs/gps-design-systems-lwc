# A collection of Lightning Web Components that align with NSW DS
This is a collection of LWCs that aligns with the [design system of Australia's New South Wales government](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-service-toolkit/design-system)

Work is still in progress and the following items have been implemented:
* Banner
* Blockquote
* Button
* Callout
* Card
* Content block
* Global alert
* Hero banner
* In-page notification
* Breadcrumb
* Checkbox group
* Radio group
* Text area
* General Input (partially) for text, numbers, checkbox, date
* Record Lookup

They all come as base non-exposed components, and for a vast majority have versions exposed for Flow and Experience Cloud targets.

## How do I learn more

Check our [gallery](https://nsw.dsforce.dev) at [https://nsw.dsforce.dev](https://nsw.dsforce.dev) for an illustration of the components and how they can be configured.
